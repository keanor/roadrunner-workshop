# Zend Expressive 3 Blog example

This is an implementation of the [blog example indepth tutorial](https://docs.zendframework.com/tutorials/in-depth-guide/first-module/), provided in the official zend framework documentation, using [zend expressive 3](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-expressive/).
I was impressed by similarities between Zend Framework 3 and Zend Expressive 3, there were very minimal variations between the two.

## Components
The components used in the example include:

Zend expressive 3,
Zend-Db,
Zend-Hydrator, and
Zend-InputFilter

The section on Zend-Form was entirely skipped, I felt it was an overkill for a small application like this.

## Setup

This project uses Composer. Run composer install to install the dependencies:

    $ composer install

You'll also need a copy of the database:

    $ cp data/blog.db.dist data/blog.db
    $ chmod a+w data/blog.db


## Run

You can run using the built-in PHP server:

```bash 
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public
```

Browse to http://localhost:8080 to view the application.
